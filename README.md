# React To-Do List App

This is a simple React To-Do List app that allows users to add tasks and displays them in a list. The app is built using `useState` to manage the list of tasks and uses basic event handlers to add new tasks. It also has a clean and modern design with a linear gradient background.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks to the list using an input field.
- **Real-Time Update**: The list updates immediately after adding a new task.
- **Linear Gradient Background**: The app has a visually appealing background with a gradient.
- **Responsive Design**: The to-do list is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
